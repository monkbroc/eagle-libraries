Particle Devices Eagle Library
====================================

In this library you'll find foot prints to make circuit boards in Eagle using the Particle devices: Spark Core, Photon and Electron.

There are for reference and you may need to adjust them for your application. See the documentation for more details on the recommended PCB foot prints.

* [Electron](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/electron-datasheet/#recommended-pcb-land-pattern)
* [Photon with headers](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/photon-datasheet/#recommended-pcb-land-pattern-photon-with-headers-)
* [Photon without headers](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/photon-datasheet/#recommended-pcb-land-pattern-photon-without-headers-)

**Show us what you make on the [community forum!](https://community.particle.io)**
